# My Own Implementation of the RSA Cryptosystem

### Inspired by Professor Looper at [UIC](https://mscs.uic.edu/profiles/nrlooper/), who instructed my amazing Math 215 course.

This implementation uses only the standard C++ library and [Boost Multiprecision integers](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/ints/cpp_int.html).
